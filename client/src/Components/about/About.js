                                <CardText>Community Report  is a web app service that provides a forum for members of the community to report incidents and share their concerns with their local government. More importantly, members of the community can see the local governments engagement with each concern based on the reported status.</CardText>
                                <CardText>This app is meant to be used in communities to crowd source discovery, identification and reporting of public issues that fall under the local government's responsibilities to address. These can come in the form of structural failures, downed trees or power lines, fires, suspicious activities, or anything that the community determines a concern that needs addressing.</CardText>
